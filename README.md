- **Web Scraping:**
    - We utilized Python libraries such as BeautifulSoup and Selenium to proficiently extract data from the Swiggy website. The scraped data encompassed crucial elements including Restaurant Names, Locations, Two-Person         Prices, Cuisines, Ratings, Delivery Review Numbers, and URLs of the restaurants.

- **Data Cleaning:**
    - Recognizing the initial data's imperfections, we employed both Pandas and Excel to execute a meticulous data cleaning process.
    - **Handled Missing Data:**
      - Addressing the presence of Null values in our dataset, we applied tailored strategies involving the use of means, medians, and modes for specific columns. This approach included filling Null values with the                Mode for categorical columns, while employing Mean and Median for numerical counterparts.

    - **Price Refinement:**
      - We further refined our data by extracting individual meal prices from the 'Price for Two' column.

- **Data Visualization:**
    - Building upon the cleaned dataset, we derived insightful patterns and trends. These valuable insights were then presented dynamically through an interactive dashboard enhanced with Slicers, providing a             
      comprehensive visualization of our findings.

- **Web Scraping:**
    - Web scraping is the process of automatically extracting data from websites. Web scraping allows you to retrieve data, such as text, images, links, and other content, from websites and save it in a structured 
      format, such as a database or spreadsheet.

- **Python Libraries: (BeautifulSoup and Selenium)**
    - Beautiful Soup is a Python library used for web scraping tasks. Beautiful Soup is commonly used for extracting information from static web pages where the content is embedded directly in the HTML. It's particularly       useful for projects that require parsing and extracting data from web pages that are not heavily reliant on JavaScript for content rendering.
    - Selenium is used for automating browser interactions, making it suitable for scraping dynamically loaded or JavaScript-heavy websites.
